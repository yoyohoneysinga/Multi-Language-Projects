# Algorithms

1. ~~**Bubble Sort Algorithm**~~  
   A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Knapsack Problem**  
   A combinatorial optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and your goal is to determine the maximum value you can carry in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

3. **N-Queens Problem**  
   A backtracking problem that asks how to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. It is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n).

5. **Insertion Sort**  
   A simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking an unsorted element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

6. **Number Factorization**  
   The process of breaking down a number into a set of factors (i.e., numbers that divide the original number without leaving a remainder). Common algorithms include trial division, Pollard's Rho, and the Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime factorization.
